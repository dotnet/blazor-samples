# Blazor Web App with OpenID Connect (OIDC)

This sample features:

* A Blazor Web App with global Auto interactivity.
* `PersistingAuthenticationStateProvider` and `PersistentAuthenticationStateProvider` services are added to the server and client Blazor apps respectively to capture authentication state and flow it between the server and client.
* OIDC authentication with Microsoft Entra without using Entra-specific packages. This sample can be used as a starting point for any OIDC authentication flow.
* Automatic non-interactive token refresh with the help of a custom `CookieOidcRefresher`.
* Secure web API call for weather data to a separate web API project. The access token is obtained from the server-side `HttpContext` and attached to outgoing requests with a custom `DelegatingHandler` service.
