# `BlazorWebAppEntra`

Sample app to accompany [Secure an ASP.NET Core Blazor Web App with Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/security/blazor-web-app-with-entra?pivots=non-bff-pattern).

**If the sample uses third-party NuGet packages, update the packages to the latest versions, including patch versions. Updating Microsoft NuGet packages to the latest patch version is optional because the .NET SDK uses the highest available patch version by default.**

## Use a production distributed token cache provider

The sample app uses in-memory distributed token caches, but a production distributed token cache provider is recommended for production apps. For more information, see [Use a production distributed token cache provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/security/blazor-web-app-with-entra?pivots=non-bff-pattern#use-a-production-distributed-token-cache-provider).
