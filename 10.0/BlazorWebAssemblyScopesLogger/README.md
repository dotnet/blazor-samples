# `BlazorWebAssemblyScopesLogger`

Sample app to accompany [ASP.NET Core Blazor logging: Client-side log scopes](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/fundamentals/logging#client-side-log-scopes).

**If the sample uses third-party NuGet packages, update the packages to the latest versions, including patch versions. Updating Microsoft NuGet packages to the latest patch version is optional because the .NET SDK uses the highest available patch version by default.**
